Every pandemic / global human crisis has brought about revolutions and
change. The US riots are a deep voice of a nation that is seeking change
and is willing to risk everything for it. It possibly comes from the
fearlessness manifested from an overwhelming fear. An existential threat
induced by something that we don't understand helps us overcome the fear
of things that we do and can understand.

A pandemic gives us the courage to stand up to injustice. It is
equalizing. The differences, the systemic injustices, the entitlements,
the privileges - everything is shattered to bits when a virus or war or
famine brings everybody down to the same plane: death, destruction and
existential dread. I'd like to call it a global equalizing event(GEE).
A GEE springs up / must spring up a desire to seek out a new normal.
A way for the world to reboot itself.

We are in the middle, maybe even early stages, of a GEE. It's a great
time for all of us to ask ourselves:

"What is the change that I seek?"


"What is the fear that I can and want to overcome?".


"What is the inequality that I have been aware of, but never confronted?"
