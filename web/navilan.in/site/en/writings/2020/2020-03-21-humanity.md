<pre>
There is no us
There is no them
Its time to dismiss
This darned jingoism

If there is one good thing
About this terrible being(?)
It cares not a thing
About color or creed or posturing

We donâ€™t have a thing to prove
Not one soul cares if our claims are true
We owe it to all of humanity
To show that we are capable of unity

Beyond our foolish pride
Beyond the lies we have lied
Beyond the people that have died
Because they chose the wrong side
</pre>
