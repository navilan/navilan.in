<pre style="width: 100%">
To think and to reason
Can never be out of season
But a billion bleating sheep
We are waiting for the beardman's whip
What is the plan my man?
What is the plan?

If you're scared and you know it clap your pots
If you're scared and you know it light your lamps
If you're scared and you know it
There's just one way to show it
Do what I say,
Don't you think about it

Whats your plan
for a testing rollout?
Whats your plan
for the economic blackout?
Whats your plan
when all the beds runout?
Whats your plan
for an eventual fallout?
What's your plan?
What's your plan my man?
What's your plan?

If you're scared and you know it clap your pots
If you're scared and you know it light your lamps
If you're scared and you know it
There's just one way to show it
Do what I say,
Don't you think about it

What's the problem?
Was this not on the agenda?
As the virus multiplies
and we run out of supplies
All these years of efforts to divide
Add up to zero
the only way to subtract
The effect of the tide
is to unite
Beyond color, creed or caste,
or the stupid religious pride.
What's the plan my man?
What's the plan?

If you're scared and you know it clap your pots
If you're scared and you know it light your lamps
If you're scared and you know it
There's just one way to show it
Do what I say,
Don't you think about it
