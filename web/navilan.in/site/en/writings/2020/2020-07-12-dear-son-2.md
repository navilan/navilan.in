Dear Son,<br>
When you see a mountain<br>
And choose to climb it,<br>
You will see<br>
Those that choose the plains.<br>
You will be alright.<br>
They will be alright.<br>
You chose high,<br>
They chose far.<br>
Remember.<br>
All that matters is<br>
Where you want to be<br>
And where you are.<br>
  </p>

Dear Son,<br>
When you climb<br>
Up that mountain,<br>
You will see people above you.<br>
Ask for help, but only when needed.<br>
They may help you.<br>
Remember.<br>
Far or high,<br>
Wherever you want to fly,<br>
Every bird wants a flock close by.<br>

<p>
Dear Son,<br>
As you climb up,<br>
Some that chose the plain,<br>
Will laugh at your choice,<br>
Wait for your fall,<br>
Call you a fool<br>
To scale the unknown,<br>
Leaving the plains to climb alone.<br>
Ignore.<br>
Remember.<br>
When you reach your peak,<br>
You will know<br>
That you have not been weak.<br>
</p>

<p>
Dear Son,<br>
As you climb up,<br>
Some that chose the plain<br>
Will applaud you and wish you well.<br>
They will wave and cheer<br>
As they move on ahead.<br>
Wave back. Cheer. Wish them luck.<br>
When you come back down,<br>
To move far after the high,<br>
You will see them return,<br>
From afar, for the high.<br>
Trade your tales.<br>
Remember.<br>
As they go higher faster,<br>
You will go faster further.<br>
</p>

<p>
Dear Son,<br>
When you have climbed high,<br>
Pause. Take a look.<br>
You will see people below you,<br>
Looking up to you.<br>
Wondering what it took.<br>
Offer help, but never insist.<br>
Remember.<br>
Far or high, wherever you fly,<br>
It never hurts to have a flock near by.<br>

<p>
Dear Son,<br>
Life is a finite adventure<br>
Of the infinite.<br>
Peaks will show you the plains,<br>
Plains will take you to the peaks.<br>
Remember.<br>
Life is not measured.<br>
Not in mere days or weeks.<br>
But by your footsteps in the plains,<br>
By the handgrips on the mountains,<br>
By the sweat of your palms, passed<br>
With every help you sought or offered.<br>
By the many lines on your face,<br>
That mark your thoughts and your smiles.<br>
