If you have not read my [initial post][] on my diagnosis and first steps towards taking control of the disease, you might want
to [take a quick scroll through it][initial post]. This is an intermediate update on my current progress and next steps.

## Health Stats

Since my last post, I've lost well over 3kgs, built some muscle and am on my way towards hitting my targeted goals.

## Workout Routine

I've been tweaking and tuning my workout routine over the past few weeks and have an efficient, effective plan that will work not just to meet my current goals, but also as a way to maintain an active life-style for the next decade.

I have a custom built workout routine that spans all 7 days with 4 days of strength + light cardio, 2 days of core + heavy cardio and one day of active recovery.

## Equipment

As I mentioned in my previous post, the fantastic, cozy gym in my apartment was unfortunately no longer sufficient for my workout needs.

I got lucky. A well equipped, clean, sufficiently-staffed Gym opened up recently, close to where I live. If you live in Chennai, near the Injambakkam area, [check these folks out][DJ]. They rock!

## Dietary Changes

Given the additional focus on muscle building, I've upped my protein intake to 100% of my body weight. I start my day with a hearty double sunny-side up, espresso laced with cocoa. Low Carb, protein heavy lunch and chicken salad for dinner has been super helpful in recovery as well as deliciously satisfying.

While we have cooked Shirataki noodles before as a novelty, I rediscovered it as part of my diabetes research and boy, what a magical gift that is. Yum! For those that are not in the know, it is technically 0% carb and delectably 100% noodley.

## Tracking Tools

I'm now using the [One Drop app][] to log and track my blood glucose. While the app is a bit too noisy for my taste, it's "journey" view is pretty cool and gives an estimated HbA1C measure.

## Next Steps

I have about 3 Kgs more to lose and significant muscle to build. There is just over a month left before I go for my next assessment to get free of medication.

I will share my detailed workout routine in the next installment of this series. I also have exciting updates coming up on other fronts. Stay tuned.
