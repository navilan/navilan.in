    step inside,
    step out,
    inside out,
    to and fro,
    it's a strange loop,
    ready to go.

    words can meter.
    words can rhyme.
    words can shape.
    words can shift.

    words are lives.
    words don't die.
    words are facts.
    words don't lie.

    when death draws close,
    yet lives don't lie,
    It's revolution.

    <summary>Revolution</summary>

<pre>

The sounds winds whistle - O brother,
Aren’t they water whirls swimming the seas?

Winding mountain paths the rivers pave - O brother,
Aren’t they life drops blooming on land?

Do you dance to thumping rhythms of beaten hearts - O brother,
Isn’t it revolution? The spiritual kind?

----

Love drops from a bleeding heart into well of emotions - O brother,
Aren’t all paths on land carved by lives drenched?

Gushing rivers borne by tallest mountains - O brother,
Aren’t ocean waves splashed by the same waters?

Do you feel the musical wind sprayed by screaming oceans - O brother
Isn’t it revolution? Breeze or storm?

----

Sound waves fly the wind’s kite -  O brother,
Water gathers to lift the oceans.

Greatest rivers are mountain paths - O brother,
Drops of lives make the valleys.

Musical feelings beat the heart’s drum - O  brother
Isn’t it revolution? Of stopping hearts?

----

Drops of heart explode emotions - O brother
Paths on land explore lives.

Clusters of rivers carve many a mountain - O brother
Ocean waves crush them to sand.

The wind rises to pool up oceans - O brother
Isn’t it revolution? When waters rage?
