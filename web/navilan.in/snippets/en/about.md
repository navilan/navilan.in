I consider myself [a storyteller][kv], [an educator][tsc], [a
programmer][github] and [a poet][Tamil] among other things. The order in terms
of competence, performance and interest changes frequently.

I desire an open, loving and respectful world. I am a parent. I'd like that for
our little boy.

I believe that a *truly* educated and creative populace is one way to make that
happen. [I am working actively][puthir] towards that goal in my corner, in my own small
way.

This website is an avenue to share my efforts, experiences, frustrations and
triumphs in that pursuit. I write here in [English][] and [Tamil][].

I am on social networks; most often in the act of being my own shill. I prefer
face to face conversations. If that's not possible, long-form email. As long as
you are *not* _{a liar, a bigot, a tribalist in any form, a disrespectful
individual}_, we'll get along fine.
