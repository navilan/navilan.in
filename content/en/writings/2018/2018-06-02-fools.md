I am big, tall and mighty.   
You dare not take me lightly.   
If it weren't for my grace,   
You wouldn't have a place.   

I am clear, soft and flexible.   
My perseverance makes anything possible.   
It may take me a thousand years,   
But I am the sum of all your fears.   

I look down and I see you, fantastic fools.   
You're nothing but nature's tools.   
There is a gorgeous world that you haven't seen,   
That will make you wonder, "Oh, where have I been".
