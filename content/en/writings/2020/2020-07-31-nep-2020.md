<summary>Introduction: Paragraph 4</summary>

> Education thus, must move towards less content, and more towards
> learning about how to think critically and solve problems, how to be
> creative and multidisciplinary, and how to innovate, adapt, and absorb
> new material in novel and changing fields.
>

</details>

The Ministry of Human Resources and Development, hereafter to be rightly
and more appropriately called the Ministry of Education released the new
National Education Policy (NEP 2020) with major reforms. The last major
change happened *34 years back*. So, this is a huge event and one that
educators like me have been rooting for a long time.

I opened the [NEP 2020](https://www.mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/nep/NEP_Final_English.pdf) document with extreme skepticism, ready to
write scathing notes on the side. I never thought that for the most part
of the document I would be nodding my head in complete agreement.

The most wonderful thing about this document is its acceptance of the
problem with the current system. A problem recognized is a problem
mostly solved. More remarkably, the policy doesn't hand wave it away as
a small problem; instead gives it a fully qualified weight: "A learning
crisis!" and promises to throw everything at it.

<details open>

<summary> Section 2.7 </summary>

> Due to the scale of the current **learning crisis**, all viable
> methods will be explored to support the teachers in mission of
> attaining universal foundational literacy and numeracy.
>
>

</details>

[My dissection of the status quo](./2020-07-14-biggest-problem.html) is a good opener to
this article as it enumerates my thoughts on what's ailing the current
education system. An education policy released after 34 years promising
reforms must be carefully analyzed:

1. Does the policy acknowledge the problems with the current system?
2. Does it offer guidelines, improvements and solutions for those
   problems?
3. Does it ignore any known major problems and for what reason?
4. Does it introduce any new problems of its own?
5. What does the policy mean to its citizens?

This article will dig deep to find answers to each of these questions.

## Overview

<details open>
<summary>Introduction: Paragraph 7</summary>

> It is based on the principle that education must develop not only
> cognitive capacities - both the 'foundational capacities' of literacy
> and numeracy and 'higher-order' cognitive capacities, such as critical
> thinking and problem solving – but also social, ethical, and emotional
> capacities and dispositions.

</details>

This section charts the course for the rest of the article by outlining
the answers to the above questions. Rest of the article will dig into
each of the points in this section to provide evidence, commentary,
illustrations and analysis from the perspective of an educator,
educational researcher and reformer.

#### Not Lipstick on a pig

<details>

<summary>Introduction: Paragraph 5</summary>

> The gap between the current state of learning outcomes and what is
> required must be bridged through undertaking major reforms that bring
> the highest quality, equity, and integrity into the system, from early
> childhood care and education through higher education.
>

</details>

NEP 2020 is not an ornamental or incremental improvement to status-quo.
It is a comprehensive reform with substantial improvements and an
ambitious vision.

#### Not a boring government memo

<details>

<summary>Section 4.36</summary>

> **The current nature of secondary school exams, including Board exams
> and entrance exams - and the resulting coaching culture of today - are
> doing much harm**, especially at the secondary school level, replacing
> valuable time for true learning with excessive exam coaching and
> preparation.
>

</details>

NEP 2020 is full of passion and major portions of the document warm the
heart of an educator like me. It is ruthless in its criticism of the
status-quo and decisive in its sense of urgency towards improving it.

#### Addresses most important problems

<details>
<summary>Introduction: Paragraph 6</summary>

>
> The aim must be for India to have **an education system by 2040 that
> is second to none**, with equitable access to the highest-quality
> education for all learners regardless of social or economic background
>

</details>

The NEP categorically and unapologetically calls out and provides
solutions for the most important problems plaguing Indian education. I
will highlight how the NEP addresses the following problems in the
upcoming sections.

##### 1. Pedagogy & Assessments

The NEP deems that the current pedagogy & assessment structure is not
just ineffective, but actively harmful.

* The current pedagogy doesn't offer any alternatives for rote-learning.
* The assessment structure mandates that students learn by rote to score
  higher.
* High stakes assessments are the norm. You score better marks or lose a
  year or worse.
* Extremely harmful "coaching culture" is encouraged to offset the
  risks.
* Perpetrates the toxic *we are in a race* mindset of parents and
  children
* Fails to cultivate student ownership in curriculum and learning
* Expresses disdain towards arts & humanities
* Establishes learning silos of distinct subjects without any crossover
* Offers no real world context or practical perspectives

![Pedagogy & Assessments](/en/writings/2020/nep2020/pedagogy-problems.png)

##### 2. Teachers

Without a motivated teacher, there is no inspired student. The NEP
acknowledges this and the fact that the current system does not reward,
encourage or even aim to enable motivated teachers. The current system
leaves teachers with:

* Low social and economic standing. It is one of the least desired
  professions.
* No autonomy in choosing pedagogy or timelines to inspire their
  students.
* No training in latest advancements in pedagogy and teaching tools.
* No professional development and growth trajectories.

![Teachers](/en/writings/2020/nep2020/teacher-problems.png)

##### 3. Educational institutions

Instead of being pillars of social advancement, educational institutions
have become symbols of unreasonable authority, unregulated entitlement,
and tools for inequality and oppression. The NEP admits this and comes
up with fixes. The current system allows:

* Educational institutions to indulge in profit-mongering at the cost of
  vulnerable sections of the population: children and uninformed
  parents.
* Low quality, specialized colleges to spring up like pests
* Monopoly and the resultant stagnation of "prestigious" institutions
  living in past glory and credits.
* Stifling of progressive institutions with lack of autonomy and
  empowerment in terms of pedagogical experimentation and research.

![Educational Institutions](/en/writings/2020/nep2020/school-problems.png)

##### 4. Research & Spending

Schools & Universities are where learning happens. Learning without
creation is stagnant consumption. Lack of spending and research
initiatives stalls progress and creates breeding grounds for bad
players. The current situation:

* Results in lack of progress in research and innovation
* Results in poor educational infrastructure
* Encourages predatory companies destroying the future of our children
  by preying upon their time and their parents money.

![Research & Spending](/en/writings/2020/nep2020/research-problems.png)

&nbsp;

#### There are some serious issues with it as well

<details>

<summary>Section 4.17</summary>

> Sanskrit, while also an important modern language mentioned in the
> Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India, possesses a classical
> literature that is greater in volume than that of Latin and Greek put
> together

</details>

NEP has the right vision and plan for the most part. However, it is not
without its problems. I'm extremely concerned about the following:

1. Sanskrit is elevated as the lingua-franca without considering
   historic, cultural and identity conflicts in such a proposition.
2. Questionable methods (AYUSH in medicine for example) are given
   importance without regard for the relative advancement of scientific
   alternatives.
3. In a country with diverse and often conflicting values, the
   requirement that teachers must espouse "Indian values" is
   impractical.
4. Unacceptably high usage of the word "holistic" :)
5. The idea of school clusters and disenfranchisement of small schools
   creates new power structures and brokers.

#### Not a pipe-dream

<details>

<summary>Section 27.3</summary>

> In the decade of 2030-40, the entire policy will be in an operational
> mode, following which another comprehensive review will be undertaken
>

</details>

It is honest in its acceptance that true change lies in implementation.
It is also reasonable in its timelines and expectations.

#### Verdict

<details>

<summary>Introduction: Paragraph 1</summary>

> India will have the highest population of young people in the world
> over the next decade, and our ability to provide high-quality
> educational opportunities to them will determine the future of our
> country.
>

</details>

The NEP is built on a principled foundation with a clear focus. It is
evident that large parts of this was written by well informed,
progressive and honest educators. It shows a good understanding of the
status quo and offers reasonable solutions based on current research in
education.

However, there is some propagandist ideology embedded in the document.
It violates the tenet: "Keep religious and political messaging out of
education". I hope that the entire policy document doesn't come under
criticism for this violation.

I will get into the nitty-gritty with excerpts from the document in the
following sections. If you do not have a tall glass of caffeine and some
snacks, its time to get some :)

## The Good Parts: Fixing the most important problems

<details open>

<summary>Introduction: Paragraph 10</summary>

> Education is a great leveller and is the best tool for achieving
> economic and social mobility, inclusion and equality.
>

</details>

The NEP has identified problems with the current system and taken a
principled approach towards solutions. In this section, I will go
through each of the identified problems and NEP's proposed solutions.

### Pedagogy & assessments

<details>

<summary>Section 4.4</summary>

> The key overall thrust of curriculum and pedagogy reform across all
> stages will be to move the education system towards **real
> understanding and towards learning how to learn - and away from the
> culture of rote learning as is largely present today**.
>
>

</details>

NEP2020 lays the foundation for fixing the curricular, pedagogical and
aspirational issues with Indian education by shifting the focus away
from rote memorization to true learning. Once again, the language used
is precise, detailed and well-researched. Let's dig in.

#### Learning to learn: Assessments are feedback

<details>

<summary>Section 4.5</summary>

> Curriculum **content will be reduced** in each subject to its core
> essentials, to **make space for critical thinking and more holistic,
> inquiry-based, discovery-based, discussion-based, and analysis based
> learning**
>

</details>

The NEP plans to address this problem by reducing the curricular
content. Decrease focus on knowledge or "push" and increase focus on
experience or "pull". The learning outcomes move away from memorization
towards creation, understanding and experiential assimilation.

![Push vs. Pull - pixel art by kavyn](/en/writings/2020/nep2020/push-vs-pull.jpg){ .small }

This is a great first step in establishing pedagogy. However, without
reforming assessments, this problem cannot be addressed. The NEP takes
that into account as well. It calls for a complete change in how
assessments are structured and evaluated.

<details>

<summary>Section 4.5</summary>

> The mandated content will **focus on key concepts, ideas,
> applications, and problem solving**. Teaching and learning will be
> conducted in a more interactive manner; questions will be encouraged,
> and classroom sessions will regularly contain more **fun, creative,
> collaborative, and exploratory activities** for students for deeper
> and more experiential learning.
>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 4.37</summary>

> While the Board exams for Grades 10 and 12 will be continued, the
> existing system of Board and entrance examinations shall be reformed
> to **eliminate the need for undertaking coaching classes**.
>

</details>

The NEP looks at assessment from 3 perspectives:

* assessment *as* learning: Tools of reflection for the student
* assessment *of* learning: Tools for the teacher to test their students
* assessment *for* learning: Tools of reflection for the teachers

Once this distinction is in the guiding principles, it is easy to
translate it in implementation. But it doesn't stop there. It goes
further by accepting the "harmful effects" of the current system and the
necessity that spending quality time ("basic effort") in school ought to
be sufficient for taking these assessments. It underscores the bold
statement with the pragmatic claim "board exams shall be made 'easy'".

<details>

<summary>Section 4.6</summary>

> The assessment tools (including **assessment "as", "of" and "for"
> learning**) will also be aligned with the learning outcomes,
> capabilities, and dispositions as specified for each subject of a
> given class.
>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 4.37</summary>

> To reverse these harmful effects of the current assessment system,
> Board exams will be redesigned to encourage holistic development;
> students will be able to choose many of the subjects in which they
> take Board exams, depending on their individualized interests. Board
> exams will also be made 'easier', in the sense that **they will test
> primarily core capacities/competencies rather than months of coaching
> and memorization;** any student who has been going to and making a
> **basic effort in a school class will be able to pass and do well** in
> the corresponding subject Board Exam without much additional effort.
>

</details>

What if a student has been having a bad day, week, month or year? Well,
not to worry, says NEP. A student is allowed to take the board exams
twice in one year. No more "high stakes" and no more coaching classes.

<details>

<summary>Section 4.37</summary>

> To further eliminate the 'high stakes' aspect of Board Exams, all
> students will be allowed to take Board Exams on **up to two occasions
> during any given school year**, one main examination and one for
> improvement, if desired.
>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 4.38</summary>

> In addition to introducing greater flexibility, student choice, and
> best-of-two attempts, assessments that primarily test core capacities
> must be the immediate key reforms to all Board exams. Boards may over
> time also **develop further viable models of Board Exams that reduce
> pressure and the coaching culture**
>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 4.34</summary>

> **The primary purpose of assessment will indeed be for learning**; it
> will help the teacher and student, and the entire schooling system,
> continuously revise teaching-learning processes to optimize learning
> and development for all students. This will be the underlying
> principle for assessment at all levels of education.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 12.1</summary>

> The assessment methods must be scientific, designed to continuously
> improve learning and **test the application of knowledge**.

</details>

&nbsp;

![Pedagogy Solutions](/en/writings/2020/nep2020/pedagogy-solutions-1.png)

The NEP shows the right amount of urgency here by aiming to get this in
motion by the academic year 2022-23.

<details>

<summary>Section 4.39</summary>

> teachers prepared, for a transformation in the assessment system **by
> the 2022-23 academic session**, to align with the NCFSE 2020-21.
>

</details>

&nbsp;

#### Own your learning: It's not a race

<details>

<summary>Section 4.42</summary>

> Students will be able to **choose the subjects for taking the test**,
> and each university will be able to see each **student's individual
> subject portfolio** and admit students into their programmes based on
> individual interests and talents.
>

</details>

There will no longer be predefined "groups" of subjects to choose from.
Students choose the subjects they are interested in and learn. This is
the most progressive change of all as this transfers the ownership to
the students. Most people in India are familiar with the conversation
"Which course / group has value?" - which translates to the amount of
jobs available in the market.

With emphasis on "individual interests and talents", NEP now not only
provides ownership of their life and learning to the children but also
challenges the risk-averse mindset of the adults. Bravo!

<details>

<summary>Section 4.2</summary>

> In particular students would continue to have the option of **exiting
> after Grade 10 and re-entering in the next phase** to pursue
> vocational or any other courses available in Grades 11- 12, including
> specialized school, at a more if so desired.
>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 11.9</summary>

> The undergraduate degree will be of either 3 or 4-year duration,
> **with multiple exit options** within this period
>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 11.9</summary>

> An Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) shall be established which would
> digitally store the academic credits earned from various recognized
> HEIs so that the degrees from an HEI can be awarded taking into
> account credits earned
>

</details>

The NEP highlights the ability of students to enter and exit the
learning process multiple times. This clearly paves way for thinking
about learning as a journey with diverse paths. Not an unforgiving
start-to-finish sprint with one final success or failure.

In combination with transferring ownership to students, these policy
decisions underscore the fact that learning is a lifelong process and
can be paused and continued at convenience perpetually.

Looking at learning as a joyous, willful process instead of a treadmill
race makes the system hugely beneficial to learners. This allows
children and adults to experiment, explore, knowing that they can always
get back to learning. This will hopefully trigger a mindset change to
remove any stigma associated with break in academic pursuit.

<details>

<summary>Section 11.5</summary>

> Imaginative and flexible curricular structures will enable creative
> combinations of disciplines for study, and would offer multiple entry
> and exit points, thus, **removing currently prevalent rigid boundaries
> and creating new possibilities for life-long learning**.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 12.2</summary>

> HEIs(Higher Education Institutions) shall also move away from
> high-stakes examinations towards more continuous and comprehensive
> evaluation.

</details>

&nbsp;

![Pedagogy Solutions](/en/writings/2020/nep2020/pedagogy-solutions-2.png)

&nbsp;

#### Learn to create: All subjects are related

<details>

<summary>Section 4.7</summary>

> Art-integration is a cross-curricular pedagogical approach that
> utilizes various aspects and forms of art and culture as the basis for
> learning of concepts across subjects

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 4.9</summary>

> There will be no hard separation among 'curricular',
> 'extracurricular', or 'co-curricular', among 'arts', 'humanities', and
> 'sciences', or between 'vocational' or 'academic' streams

</details>

NEP delivers the final gut-punch to the vicious cycle of *schools +
marks = jobs*. The NEP admits that unless children are
multi-dimensional, look beyond the subject and look into the connections
and relationships, they are not preparing themselves for a creative
21st-century life.

It scolds the current system for looking down upon arts, humanities,
vocational skills, etc, and placing all the bets on the "job landing"
skills instead of "job creating" skills.

<details>

<summary>Section 16.3</summary>

> **Vocational education is perceived to be inferior** to mainstream
> education and meant largely for students who are unable to cope with
> the latter. This is a perception that affects the choices students
> make. It **is a serious concern** that can only be dealt with by a
> complete re-imagination of how vocational education is offered to
> students in the future

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 11.6</summary>

> Pedagogy will have an increased emphasis on communication, discussion,
> debate, research, and opportunities for **cross-disciplinary and
> interdisciplinary thinking**.

</details>

Once again, with my heart brimming with pride, I acknowledge the
competence of the authors when they proclaim how humanities are a
great vessel for learning.

It even goes onto mockingly praise "bagless periods" clearly suggesting
how harmful it is to view children as dumpsters of knowledge instead of
joyful learners from experience.

The NEP, by acknowledging the problems with the current system, has
given validation for honest, do-good, progressive educators like us and
for that I'm so grateful.

<details>

<summary>Section 9.2</summary>

> Some of the major problems currently faced by the higher education
> system in India include:
>
> ...
>
> **a rigid separation of disciplines, with early specialisation and
> streaming of students into narrow areas of study**;

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 4.6</summary>

> In all stages, experiential learning will be adopted, including
> hands-on learning, arts-integrated and sports-integrated education,
> story-telling-based pedagogy, among others, as standard pedagogy
> within each subject, and with **explorations of relations among
> different subjects**.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 4.26</summary>

> All students will participate in a **10-day bagless period** sometime
> during Grades 6-8 where they intern with local vocational experts such

</details>

### Teachers

<details open>

<summary>Principles of this policy</summary>

> **teachers and faculty as the heart of the learning process** – their
> recruitment, continuous professional development, positive working
> environments and service conditions;

</details>

&nbsp;

#### Not the bottom of the barrel: Teachers are pillars of a society

<details>

<summary>Section 5.1</summary>

> **Teachers truly shape the future of our children - and, therefore,
> the future of our nation.** It is because of this noblest role that
> the teacher in India was the most respected member of society. **Only
> the very best and most learned became teachers**. Society gave
> teachers, or gurus, what they needed to pass on their knowledge,
> skills, and ethics optimally to students.

</details>

The NEP puts teachers in their well deserved and rightful pedestals.
*Mata, Pita, Guru, Deivam* says an oft-cited ancient proverb. Most
interpretations give "Mata", Mom, the first place. But given the
patriarchal nature of most old civilizations, a fairer interpretation
would be that the teacher is second only to God.

One of the more terrible side-effects of industrialization has been the
fall in the status of a teacher. "Those that can't do, teach" is more
widely accepted than the interpretations above. The result of reduction
in social standing of teachers has meant that even the most passionate
educators have a difficult choice when choosing their profession.

<details>

<summary>Section 5.1</summary>

> The quality of teacher education, recruitment, deployment, service
> conditions, and empowerment of teachers is not where it should be, and
> consequently the quality and motivation of teachers does not reach the
> desired standards. **The high respect for teachers and the high status
> of the teaching profession must be restored** so as to inspire the
> best to enter the teaching profession. The motivation and empowerment
> of teachers is required to ensure the best possible future for our
> children and our nation.

</details>

The NEP completely acknowledges this fall in status and accepts the
pressing necessity of restoring the teaching profession's dignity to
make a lasting change. Elevating teaching as a creative and essential
profession instead of a last choice aspiration is a reform that could
change the course of a country.

The evidence that the NEP takes this seriously comes in the form of
"reduced non-teaching duties" and "increased management positions" for
teachers so that they are adequately represented and can influence
progress.

<details>

<summary>Section 5.11</summary>

> In collaboration with parents and other key local stakeholders,
> teachers will also be more involved in the governance of
> schools/school complexes, including as members of the School
> Management Committees/School Complex Management Committees

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 5.12</summary>

> To prevent the large amounts of time spent currently by teachers on
> non-teaching activities, **teachers will not be engaged any longer in
> work that is not directly related to teaching.**

</details>

&nbsp;

![Teachers Solutions](/en/writings/2020/nep2020/teachers-solutions-1.png)

&nbsp;

#### Teacher Empowerment : No glass ceilings

Teaching is a job with extremities. You may be teaching the same thing
for 20 years, yet every class is different and every student is unique.
You have to change your methods, adapt them to better suit your class.

<details>

<summary>Section 5.14</summary>

> Teachers will be given **more autonomy in choosing aspects of
> pedagogy**, so that they may teach in the manner they find **most
> effective for the students** in their classrooms.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 5.14</summary>

> Teachers will **be recognized for novel approaches** to teaching that
> improve learning outcomes in their classrooms

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 5.17</summary>

> **Teachers doing outstanding work must be recognized and promoted, and
> given salary raises**, to incentivize all teachers to do their best
> work. Therefore, a robust merit-based structure of tenure, promotion,
> and salary structure will be developed, with multiple levels within
> each teacher stage, that incentivizes and recognizes outstanding
> teachers.

</details>

When there is no autonomy, even the most passionate teacher gets
disillusioned by the day and ends up being an uninspiring drone. The NEP
recognizes this aspect of the profession and duly addresses it. It
promises autonomy in choosing the pedagogy. In combination with the
reduced curricular content, this empowers teachers to be more effective,
to connect with their students and inspire them.

It doesn't stop there but proposes incentives for teachers that use this
autonomy to innovate. What about the teachers that are
institutionalized in the old ways? We'll train them, says the NEP. A
mandatory 50 hours of training to keep them abreast of advancements in
their field.

<details>

<summary>Section 5.15</summary>

> Each teacher will be expected to participate in **at least 50 hours of
> CPD(Continuous professional development) opportunities** every year
> for their own professional development, driven by their own interests.
> CPD opportunities will, in particular, systematically cover the latest
> pedagogies regarding foundational literacy and numeracy, formative and
> adaptive assessment of learning outcomes, competency-based learning,
> and related pedagogies, such as experiential learning,
> arts-integrated, sports-integrated, and storytelling-based approaches,
> etc.

</details>

What about economics? What about career growth? The NEP has answers for
that as well. It recognizes that there is no class hierarchy in teaching
kindergarten versus college students. It recognizes that in each
specialized age-group there needs to be career growth. Teachers do not
have to graduate to teaching higher classes to earn more.

<details>

<summary>Section 5.18</summary>

> Further, it will be ensured that career growth (in terms of tenure,
> promotions, salary increases, etc.) is available to teachers within a
> single school stage (i.e., Foundational, Preparatory, Middle, or
> Secondary), and that there is no career progression-related incentive
> to move from being teachers in early stages to later stages or vice
> versa (though such career moves across stages will be allowed,
> provided the teacher has the desire and qualifications for such a
> move). This is to support the fact that all stages of school education
> will require the highest-quality teachers, and **no stage will be
> considered more important than any other**.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 15.5</summary>

> Beyond **the teaching of cutting-edge pedagogy**, the teacher
> education will include grounding in sociology, history, science,
> psychology, early childhood care and education, foundational literacy
> and numeracy,

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 5.19</summary>

> **Vertical mobility of teachers based on merit will also be
> paramount**; outstanding teachers with demonstrated leadership and
> management skills would be trained over time to take on academic
> leadership positions in schools, school complexes, BRCs, CRCs, BITEs,
> DIETs as well as relevant government departments

</details>

With comprehensive understanding of the teacher issues related to
motivation, training, performance and autonomy, the NEP meticulously
empowers teachers to be their most effective selves.

![Teachers Solutions](/en/writings/2020/nep2020/teachers-solutions-2.png)

### Educational Institutions

<details open>

<summary>Section 8.3</summary>

> **The current regulatory regime also has not been able to curb the
> commercialization and economic exploitation of parents by many
> for-profit private schools**, yet at the same time it has all too
> often inadvertently discouraged public-spirited private/philanthropic
> schools.

</details>

In education, there are only a few light bearers left. Most educational
institutions are money spinners, many are funded and run by corporate,
political or religious entities with hidden agendas. Some funded "tech"
ventures are outright scams luring unsuspecting parents into enrolling
their kids through predatory sales funnels and blackmailing using
parental guilt or greed.

There are a precious few who try to move things forward, keep the
interests of students above everything and understand the unquestionable
importance of their work. But these institutions have been suffocated by
regulations and boards that take away their much needed autonomy to
bring about true change.

Does the NEP address these issues?

#### Education is public service: Rampant commercialization is predatory

</details>

The NEP immediately recognizes how the current policies and regulations
have failed to stop predatory behavior from private educational
institutions. It mandates that all educational institutions be treated
on par with non-profit organizations.

It also emphasizes that the fees and incidentals be laid out
transparently on the websites and other public communication platforms.

There is even a complete section (18.12 - 18.14) dedicated to "Curbing
Commercialization of Education". The NEP takes a balanced stand so that
"Making a living out of education" is encouraged but "Making living a
hell for parents and children through rampant commercialization" is
discouraged.

<details>

<summary>Section 18.14</summary>

> Private HEIs having a philanthropic and public-spirited intent will be
> encouraged through a progressive regime of fees determination.
> Transparent mechanisms for fixing of fees with an upper limit, for
> different types of institutions depending on their accreditation, will
> be developed so that **individual institutions are not adversely
> affected**.

</details>

Commercialization and profiteering from education is a huge problem. The
good news is, the NEP acknowledges it and suggests some measures to curb
it.

#### Education needs accountability: Mediocrity is unacceptable

<details>

<summary>Section 10.11</summary>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 10.14</summary>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 10.4</summary>

> Over a period of time, it is envisaged that every college would

</details>

The NEP goes back to the first principles of what it means to be a
university. The various qualified uses of "university" are no longer
possible. There is a singular definition of what it means to be an
university. Well, there always has been. The NEP now acknowledges the
fact.

The infestation of low quality "Engineering" colleges is also
highlighted by the requirement that a college needs to be a part of
multidisciplinary entity. The NEP brings IITs into the fold as well by
requiring them to transform into multidisciplinary entities.

By allowing foreign universities (in the top 100) to setup campuses in
India, the NEP challenges IITs & IIMs to raise their standards and
innovate. It is no longer possible to stagnate by resting on past
laurels and entitled glory.

The elevation of arts, humanities and vocational education will also
help in reducing the unreasonable and unsustainable demand for
specialized engineering education.

<details>

<summary>Section 11.4</summary>

> **Even engineering institutions, such as IITs, will move towards more
> holistic and multidisciplinary education** with more arts and
> humanities.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 12.8</summary>

> High performing Indian universities will be encouraged to set up
> campuses in other countries, and similarly, selected universities
> e.g., **those from among the top 100 universities in the world will be
> facilitated to operate in India**

</details>

The NEP has comprehensive plans and guidelines to increase the quality
of higher education.

![Educational Institutions - Solutions](/en/writings/2020/nep2020/school-solutions-2.png)

&nbsp;

#### Education needs improvement: The world does not stand still

<details>

<summary>Section 23.10</summary>

> HEIs will play an active role not only in conducting research on
> disruptive technologies but also **in creating initial versions of
> instructional materials and courses** including online courses in
> cutting-edge domains and assessing their impact on specific areas such
> as professional education.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 7.8</summary>

> The **school complex/cluster will be given significant autonomy by the
> DSE to innovate towards providing integrated education and to
> experiment with pedagogies, curriculum, etc.,** while adhering to the
> National Curricular Framework (NCF) and State Curricular Framework
> (SCF). Under this organization, schools will gain in strength, will be
> able to exercise greater freedom, and will contribute towards making
> the complex more innovative and responsive. Meanwhile, the DSE will be
> able to focus on the aggregate level goals that need to be achieved,
> improving overall system effectiveness

</details>

The NEP, with immense clarity, acknowledges the need to provide autonomy
to schools to innovate while at the same time having some kind of
central guidelines to ensure that the innovations are not regressive.

<details>

<summary>Section 7.10</summary>

> To further enhance cooperation and positive synergy among schools,
> including between public and private schools, the twinning/pairing of
> one public school with one private school will be adopted across the
> country, so that such paired schools may meet/interact with each
> other, learn from each other, and also share resources, if possible.
> **Best practices of private schools will be documented, shared, and
> institutionalized in public schools**, and vice versa, where possible

</details>

The depth of thought in the policy is astounding here as it
also recognizes the need for these innovations to percolate across
institutions. The pairing of public and private schools is a wonderful
idea and I wish and hope it is one of the first things to be implemented
by the new Ministry of Education.

The NEP goes above and beyond solving the problem by laying out
guidelines for continuous improvement.

### Research & Spending

<details open>

<summary>Section 17.3</summary>

> Despite this critical importance of research, **the research and
> innovation investment in India is, at the current time, only 0.69% of
> GDP** as compared to 2.8% in the United States of America, 4.3% in
> Israel and 4.2% in South Korea.

</details>

Most cutting edge innovations in the last 100 years from the Internet,
to Google to Artificial Intelligence to Programming Languages have their
roots in university research. What percentage of those innovations are
from universities in India? The numbers are decidedly shame-worthy. Does
the NEP address this as a concern?

#### Learning is creation: No research, no progress

<details>

<summary>Section 17.5</summary>

> Research in the arts and humanities, along with innovations in the
> sciences and social sciences, are, therefore, extremely important for
> the progress and enlightened nature of a nation

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 17.9</summary>

> To build on these various elements in a synergistic manner, and to
> thereby truly grow and catalyze quality research in the nation, this
> policy **envisions the establishment of a National Research
> Foundation** (NRF).

</details>

The NEP admits to the current lack of focus on research and emphasizes
the need to invest, nurture and enable educational institutions as
knowledge factories. To bolster that effort, it envisions a new entity
NRF (National Research Foundation) whose sole purpose is to set up and
advance research in educational institutions. The NEP brings up
"Knowledge Creation" to refer to research efforts giving it a creative
emphasis instead of the usual, dry, mechanical perspective offered.

This is a major shift in perspective from the current situation. The NEP
furthers the cause by stating that "a strong culture of research"
implies a strong culture of learning. If this stance is solidified,
institutions with better research will become more coveted by the
students establishing a wonderful virtuous cycle.

<details>

<summary>Section 17.6</summary>

> Research and innovation at education institutions in India,
> particularly those that are engaged in higher education, is critical.
> **Evidence from the world's best universities throughout history shows
> that the best teaching and learning processes at the higher education
> level occur in environments where there is also a strong culture of
> research and knowledge creation;** conversely, much of the very best
> research in the world has occurred in multidisciplinary university
> settings.

</details>

&nbsp;

#### Invest in Research: Knowledge creation will pay for itself

While there are multiple organizations that fund research, the funding
is minuscule compared to the rest of the world. Without adequate
funding, most research projects are curtailed in their ambitions and
runway, and are forced to resort to mediocre findings or worse,
plagiarism.

<details>

<summary>Section 17.11</summary>

> The primary activities of the NRF will be to:
>
> (a) fund competitive, peer-reviewed grant proposals of all types and
> across all disciplines;
>
> (b) seed, grow, and facilitate research at academic institutions,
> particularly at universities and colleges where research is currently
> in a nascent stage, through mentoring of such institutions;
>
> (c) act as a liaison between researchers and relevant branches of
> government as well as industry, so that research scholars are
> constantly made aware of the most urgent national research issues, and
> so that policymakers are constantly made aware of the latest
> breakthroughs; so as to optimally allow breakthroughs to be brought
> into policy and/or implementation; and
>
> (d) recognise outstanding research and progress

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 26.2</summary>

> The Centre and the States will work together to increase the public
> investment in Education sector to reach **6% of GDP at the earliest**.
> This **is considered extremely critical** for achieving the
> high-quality and equitable public education system that is truly
> needed for India's future economic, social, cultural, intellectual,
> and technological progress and growth.

</details>

The NEP ordains the NRF with the primary responsibility of funding
worthy research projects. It further instructs the NRF to act as a
mentor to ensure the success of such projects and be the conduit for
relationship with industry.

The establishment of NRF and its responsibilities definitely move the
needle forward in terms of establishing research wings in universities.

![Research & Spending Solutions](/en/writings/2020/nep2020/research-solutions-1.png)

## The Mediocre Parts: What could've been better?

The NEP 2020 is probably one of the most radically progressive policy
documents to be published by the Indian government. There are few parts
where the policy avoids greatness and embraces mediocrity.

### Assessments: So close, yet so far

<details>

<summary>Section 4.38</summary>

> Some possibilities include: a system of annual/semester/modular Board
> Exams could be developed - that each test far less material, and are
> taken immediately after the corresponding course is taken in school -
> so that **the pressure from exams** is better distributed, less
> intense, and less high-stakes across the Secondary Stage

</details>

It is never okay to blame a child to not meet the standards set by
adults. The fault is always with the grown up. The NEP comes very close
to saying that. However, it stops short of it and says the student is
allowed to attempt one more time to "improve" their scores.

Why did the student not get a good score the first time? Is the student
to be blamed? What are the living conditions of the student? Are there
any learning difficulties faced by them? Are there other personal,
social or emotional issues that are deterring them from being their
best? How can the policy help?

I wish these questions were asked and answered.

### Teachers: More should be done

<details>

<summary>Section 5.12 - Review/Circulation version</summary>

> **teachers will not be involved in electioneering, cooking of midday
> meals**, and other strenuous administrative tasks, so that they may
> fully concentrate on their teaching-learning duties.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 5.12 - Final version</summary>

> teachers will not be involved in strenuous administrative tasks and
> more than **a rationalized minimum time for mid-day meal related
> work**,

</details>

An earlier version of the NEP proclaimed that teachers shall no longer
be required to perform electioneering. The final version, however, has
removed that statement. I hope it is removed to make sure there is
sufficient time to find alternatives. Because, as the document says,
teaching requires a lot of time, energy (emotional, physical and mental)
and effort and teachers should not be distracted with anything else.

<details>

<summary>Section 13.6</summary>

> A system of multiple parameters **for proper performance assessment**,
> for the purposes of 'tenure' i.e., confirmed employment after
> probation, promotion, salary increases, recognitions, etc., including
> peer and student reviews, innovations in teaching and pedagogy,
> quality and impact of research, professional development activities,
> and other forms of service to the institution and the community, shall
> be developed by each HEI and clearly enunciated in it 's Institutional
> Development Plan (IDP).

</details>

Teaching is one of the top professions in Finland and many of the
educationally progressive countries. The NEP talks highly about the
profession and promises salary increases and career development. But
will it make teaching a coveted profession? No such promise has been
made.

### IITs and IIMs: No call to action

<details>

<summary>Section 11.11</summary>

> Model public universities for holistic and multidisciplinary
> education, **at par with IITs, IIMs,** etc., called MERUs
> (Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities) will be set up
> and will aim to attain the highest global standards in quality
> education. They will also help set the highest standards for
> multidisciplinary education across India.

</details>

With the wonderful privileges granted to these institutions, why have
they not created revolutionary, industry defining work products? These
institutions have been operating with impunity and privilege all these
years and they should have been explicitly called out for their
ineptitude. If they are not called out, how can the new MERUs be held
accountable for their quality of effort?

### Research oriented & Learning oriented universities

<details>

<summary>Section 10.3</summary>

> The definition of university will thus allow a spectrum of
> institutions that range from those that place equal emphasis on
> teaching and research i.e., **Research-intensive Universities, those
> that place greater emphasis on teaching but still conduct significant
> research i.e. Teaching-intensive Universities.**

</details>

The NEP proclaims with authority that universities with excellent
research thrive as better learning environments. Given that assertion,
why allow learning / teaching oriented universities? Why can't all
universities have brilliant research wings?

### EdTech Companies: No promise to stop predatory behavior

<details>

<summary>Section 10.10</summary>

> Top institutions accredited for ODL will be encouraged and supported
> to develop high-quality online courses. Such quality online courses
> will be suitably integrated into curricula of HEIs, and **blended mode
> will be preferred.**

</details>

There is no regulation on corporate entities profiting with schemes and
deals that prey on parental insecurity and guilt. This impacts children,
the most vulnerable section of a society. While the policy document is
critical of coaching culture and proclaims that it will cease to exist,
it doesn't promise any regulations on predatory entities.

With the overwhelming support for online courses in educational
institutions, these entities will gain more credibility and standing and
without regulatory supervision, may destroy all the good things this
policy aims for.

## The Concerning Parts: Things to be careful about

Education shapes the minds of people. Education can make the population
thrive or suffer. In a diverse, large, dense country like India, a
radical change in national policy is no small thing. The citizenry
should be literate of the changes, praise the good, and question the
bad.

Like natural resources and the environment, an education policy can
leave its mark on multiple generations.

### Education in Indian Languages

<details>

<summary>Section 4.11</summary>

> Wherever possible, **the medium of instruction until at least Grade 5,
> but preferably till Grade 8 and beyond, will be the home
> language/mother tongue/local language/regional language**. Thereafter,
> the home/local language shall continue to be taught as a language
> wherever possible. This will be followed by both public and private
> schools. High-quality textbooks, including in science, will be made
> available in home languages/mother tongue.

</details>

Early childhood education happening in local languages is a fantastic
leveler. It reduces the chasm between children from either side of the
great Indian economic divide.

However, the NEP, while mandating education in the local language, does
not get into how it will ascertain the distribution of resources among
the myriad of languages in India or how standards will be maintained
across these languages.

Will the educational material be created in one language (any guesses?)
and others will be mediocre translations? Will it depend on the states
to make their language material on par with other languages? Will funds
be allocated in proportion to population or equally? What about state
level minority languages?

Suddenly, there is a new educational meridian: A linguistic line of
division. Who will make sure that this line of division doesn't
bifurcate the population into another class system of haves and
have-nots?

### Elevation of Sanskrit

<details>

<summary>Section 4.17</summary>

> **Sanskrit will thus be offered at all levels of school and higher
> education as an important, enriching option for students**, including
> as option in the three-language formula. It will be taught in ways
> that are interesting and experiential as well as contemporarily
> relevant, including through the use of Sanskrit Knowledge Systems, and
> in particular through phonetics and pronunciation. Sanskrit textbooks
> at the foundational and middle school level may be written in Simple
> Standard Sanskrit (SSS) to teach Sanskrit through Sanskrit (STS) and
> make its study truly enjoyable.

</details>

Most old civilizations have dark histories. History of oppression,
cruelty, slavery, genocide or even cannibalism. India is not an
exception. For some, it is the good old days. For others, it is the
horrors of the past.

Sanskrit is a language of the past. It is not spoken in common. Not for
centuries. It brings with it the past and the events associated with
that time. Even in its prime, it was the language of the elites, the
oppressors. So, bringing back Sanskrit begs the question, are we
bringing back those days, the days of the oppressors and the oppressed?
Are we granting the moral sanction to our society that some people are
more equal than the others? Aren't we past all that?

Some may ask, isn't English the language of a more recent oppressor?
Yes, it is. But the oppressors are not around anymore, are they? The
people that used Sanskrit as a tool for their oppression, though, are
still around. They are in the philosophies handed down to their
descendants. They are in the prejudices carried forward socially. These
prejudices, so far, have had no legal or political sanction. Question
is, are we accepting those prejudices now?

Some may say, isn't it necessary for children to learn the rich
literature of ancient India? The rich literature of ancient India
includes volumes of epics in other languages as well. So, what makes
Sanskrit special? Why is the NEP elevating its status as the language
that defines India or Indian-ness?

Some Dravidian languages claim to be as old as Sanskrit and are in
active use today with words from ancient poetry finding their way into
movie songs. For many Indians, their language is part of their identity,
their pride, their strength - their roar when they fought oppression,
their prayer when they sang in devotion, their affection when they
composed their creations. Why alienate their sense of pride, emotion and
identity? Linguistic pluralism is as important an aspect of being
Indian as any other. Why does the NEP ignore this?

So, what does the special status offered to Sanskrit in a National
Education Policy mean to India? A populace that could easily be divided
in a million ways? I'm very concerned. You should be too.

### Elevation of AYUSH

<details>

<summary>Section 20.5</summary>

> Given that people exercise **pluralistic choices in healthcare**, our
> healthcare education system must be integrative meaning thereby that
> **all students of allopathic medical education must have a basic
> understanding of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and
> Homeopathy (AYUSH),** and vice versa.

</details>

Modern medicine powered by scientific method has helped increase the
average life-span of a human being to almost a century. Every old
civilization, historically, has its own medicine and medicine men/women.
Some of those treatments are miraculous and under-explored.

Exploring any form of knowledge must be appreciated and encouraged. So
active research in traditional Indian medicine (Ayurveda, Unani &
Siddha), physical exercises (Yoga) are to be carried out in research
institutions. Scientific method must be applied to these age old
treatments to gather sufficient evidence before it is accepted and sold
in pharmacies.

However, taking the old medical practices at face value, without
employing the scientific method is not sensible. The policy cannot on
the one hand talk about "scientific temper" and on the other encourage
teaching old practices without applying the same rigor.

The "H" in AYUSH is another concerning element. There is sufficient
literature debunking the credibility of homeopathy as a medical
practice. It is not even traditional Indian medicine. It seems to garner
support in the policy document only as an alternative approach to
"scientific temper".

### New power brokers

<details>

<summary>Section 5.10</summary>

> The creation of school complexes could go a long way towards building
> vibrant teacher communities. The hiring of teachers to school
> complexes could automatically create relationships among schools
> across the school complex; it would also help ensure excellent
> subject-wise distribution of teachers, creating a more vibrant teacher
> knowledge base. **Teachers at very small schools will not remain
> isolated any longer and may become part of and work with larger school
> complex communities, sharing best practices with each other** and
> working collaboratively to ensure that all children are learning.
> School complexes could also share counsellors, trained social workers,
> technical and maintenance staff, etc. to further support teachers and
> help create an effective learning environment.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Section 10.2</summary>

> **Moving to large multidisciplinary universities and HEI clusters is
> thus the highest recommendation** of this policy regarding the
> structure of higher education.

</details>

The introduction of "school complexes" and "Multi-disciplinary
university clusters" brings into effect more power brokers. Who heads
the complexes? Who heads these clusters? How can we make sure the small
fish is not consumed by the big fish?

Historically, education has been propelled in smaller settings.
Pedagogical innovation happens at a small scale and then gets
propagated. How will the ministry help the small fish assert themselves?
How will their autonomy be protected? How can they derive a reasonable
and deserving benefit from their innovations?

### Holistic :)

<details>

<summary>Section 11: Towards a More Holistic and Multidisciplinary Education</summary>

</details>

There are 34 uses of the word "holistic" in the document. Precise words
like "multidisciplinary", "cross functional", and "experiential
learning" are used in other parts of the document. I wish the authors
had used more contextually meaningful and descriptive words instead,
lending more credibility to the otherwise *holistic* content in the
document.

## What does it mean to me?

This is a radical policy change after 34 years. The policy document is
extremely critical of the status-quo to the point where it uses words
like "harmful", "ineffective", "crisis", etc.,

It proposes radical changes to pedagogy, teaching, school structure,
and higher education at a foundational level. It goes onto say that a
complete implementation of the guidelines in the policy will be done by
the year 2030. Some of the proposed changes have an ambitious
deadline: 2022. So, no matter who you are, you will feel the impact of
this policy.

### I'm a Student

Your government just told that the current system of education is
ineffective and the assessments could be harmful. Rote learning is
insufficient and experiential learning with complete understanding is
essential.

Here are a few things to think about:

1. Change your approach to learning. Ask more questions. Don't stop
   until you understand.
2. It is better to understand one thing really well than memorize 10
   things and not understand them at all.
3. Your marks don't define you. They are simply a few metrics to get
   what you want. You have all the time in the world. The most important
   thing is to enjoy your learning.
4. You are not in a race. Find pleasure in learning new things.
5. There are more fields than engineering and medicine. Arts and
   humanities are important.
6. Learn more about your country, its people, their languages and
   culture.
7. Be a good citizen. Understand the current affairs. Be aware of how
   the world is operating around you. Try to figure out your place in
   this world - it is a life-long process - better to start early.

### I'm a Parent

Give your children the freedom of choice. Don't guilt them with their
performance in examination. Ensure that they enjoy learning. Encourage
them to question and understand. They will have to compete with better
prepared youngsters produced by an improved education system; it is up
to you to ensure that your children are well rounded.

Read the [above section](#im-a-student). Then read [the section on
parents](./2020-07-14-biggest-problem.html#parents-1) in my previous article. You can do
exactly what is said in that article, but now you can do it with
authority. Your government stands with you. Use the NEP as your guide
and enforcer.

### I'm a Teacher

Read the NEP from start to finish. Get acquainted with pedagogical
improvements across the world. Ask yourself these questions:

1. What is the best way for my students to learn this without me
   teaching it? Can they experience / discover it somehow?
2. How can I make my students enjoy what I'm supposed to teach? Am I
   inspiring them?
3. Are there any games that can make the learning joyful? Can I create
   them?
4. Are my students asking enough questions? How can I make them ask more
   questions?
5. Are my students debating among themselves?
6. Who is talking more? Me or my students?
7. Can my students apply what they just learned?
8. How can I help my students see relationships, connections and
   patterns among the things they learn?
9. Are there real world examples that I can use as a guideline to
   inspire my students?

### I'm a School

You need to change. Now! Hire teachers that can inspire your students.
Pay them well. Ensure you have teachers who are multi-talented. Ensure
that there are inspiring art, music and sports activities in your
curriculum and teachers that are passionate creators and performers.

Stop blaming your students and start helping them. When a student is
"non-performing", it is your fault. Not theirs. What can you do to help?
Where did *you* fail?

Read [suggestions from my previous article](./2020-07-14-biggest-problem.html#schools-1).

### I'm an after school academic tutor

The NEP clearly calls after school coaching centers as harmful. Find
something else to do. Children's time is precious. It is unacceptable
for children to do the same thing at school and after school.

Read the NEP. Become a teacher - an exceptional one. Start a school.
Anything but a tuition center.

### I'm an EdTech Startup offering academic support

If the slow, under-the-breath chastising of your predatory behavior has
not reached your ears, the NEP scolds you in loudest terms. "Harmful
coaching culture", it says. You are the prime perpetrator. You are not
the attentive personal academic tutor above, but you are the lustful
predator that lures guilty, insecure parents into your trap.

Shutdown, retire and do something good for the society, for a change.

### I'm the Ministry of Education

Kudos. I bow my head to the most wonderful thing I've read in Indian
education. As an educator and education reformer, this document has
validated my work, effort and words. Thank you.

Please pay attention to the [concerns highlighted](#the-concerning-parts-things-to-be-careful-about) in this
article. They may be political requirements. If so, please move them to
an addendum so that the credibility of the rest of this incredible
document is not questioned.

## Summary

There are many more wonderful things like special education, adult and
life-long learning, nutrition, etc that are covered in the NEP. They are
to be read and relished.

As an Indian citizen, as an educator, as a parent the NEP has filled me
with hope. It has given me fuel to continue my work. It has given my
words recognition and validation. It has given me an authority to appeal
to. For that I'm immensely thankful.

There are some propagandist ideologies and scientific missteps
highlighted in the article that I'm deeply concerned about. That said, I
am surprised, thankful and excited about this progressive, scientific,
visionary policy.

The future of Indian education shines bright.
